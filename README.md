># Development of a deep learning model for automated detection of Breast Cancer 💻

## Introduction 🧐
This project is on a mission to save lives! 💪 Our goal is to develop a deep learning solution for the *classification of breast cancer* using histopathological images. We want to investigate the best possible outcome using the VGG-16 architecture and normalization techniques such as image tilting, zooming, and rotation. The focus is to *improve the accuracy and reliability of breast cancer diagnosis* through the integration of computer vision and image processing techniques.

## Objectives 🎯
1. Implement a deep learning model using the VGG-16 architecture for the classification of breast cancer.
2. Evaluate the model's performance using various normalization techniques.
3. Improve the accuracy and reliability of breast cancer diagnosis through the integration of computer vision and image processing techniques.

## Requirements 💻
- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
